Jack Audio X11 apps for audio visualization
===========================================

The apps show themselves as a kind of 'virtual instruments' on your desktop.

Funfacts:
1) The pictures of the instruments are from ones that I own personally.
   - The spectrum analyzer is a Hewlett Packard HP-8591A.
   - The scope is a Philips PM-3295.
2) Uses shared memory X-window imaging for fast updating of the the graphics.
3) All useful intrument controls (knobs, displays etc.) are defined and can have callback code attached, but currently only the powerbuttons and topleft corners are functional in that way.
4) The instruments are resizeable in the most strangest of ways 🙃.

Current state: Initial commit
Source is still a bit messy, lots of viral introns in code, but all code written by me.

Platforms:
----------
Linux with X11, Xext, and Jack dev libraries.

e.g. ubuntu:
```
$ apt install x11proto-dev libjack-dev
```

How to Compile (currently):
---------------------------

```
$ ./make.sh
```

How to run
----------

- Spectrum analyzer:
```
$ ./xdisp
```

- Scope:
```
$ ./xdisp --scope
```
![scope](https://github.com/noudio/MrMessy/blob/main/doc/xdisp-scope.png)

- Black:
```
(bash)$ ./xdisp --black
```
This can be useful for video grabbing, due to its black background. I used it for example to create this youtube vid: [andjelisa on rararadio](https://youtu.be/DI8FW4kV9h8?list=PL6jUM7gk5v0XpZLoLPm6GyWbw1ySJ1M1x&t=6864) , translating the black background to transparent and rotating the output by 90 degs 😎

- Click the top-left corner of the instrument to have the app as a non-decorated desktop app (i.e. no borders and caption). Press it again to undo this, for repositioning or resizing.

By default 'xdisp' only creates jack ports, but it doesnt connect them. Use jackctl patch bay to setup automatic connections.
Or otherwise `./xdisp [--connect]` makes an automatic connection to the writers of the system output.
