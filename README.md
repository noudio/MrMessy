Jack Audio X11 apps for audio visualization
===========================================

The apps show themselves as a kind of 'virtual instruments' on your desktop.

Funfacts:
1) The pictures of the instruments are from ones that I own personally.
2) All sensible intrument controls (knobs, displays etc.) can have callback code attached, currently only the powerbuttons and topleft corners are functional.
3) The instruments are resizeable in the most strangest of ways.
4) Press the top-left corner of an instrument, to have the window as a borderless desktop app

Current state: Initial commit
Source is still a bit messy, lots of viral introns in code

Platforms:
----------
linux with X11, Xext, and Jack dev libraries.

e.g. ubuntu:
apt install x11proto-dev libjack-dev

How to Compile (currently):
---------------------------

./make.sh

How to run
----------

spectrum analyzer:
(bash)$ ./xdisp

![spectrum-analyzer](https://github.com/noudio/MrMessy/blob/main/doc/xdisp-spectrum-analyzer.png)

scope:
(bash)$ ./xdisp --scope

![scope](https://github.com/noudio/MrMessy/blob/main/doc/xdisp-scope.png)

scope:
(bash)$ ./xdisp --black

This one can be useful for video grabbing, due to its black background. I used it for example to create this youtube vid: [andjelisa on rararadio](https://youtu.be/DI8FW4kV9h8?list=PL6jUM7gk5v0XpZLoLPm6GyWbw1ySJ1M1x&t=6864) , translating the black background to transparent and rotating the output by 90 degs ðŸ˜Ž

By default 'xdisp' only creates jack ports, but it doesnt connect them.
Use jackctl patch bay to setup automatic connections.
Or otherwise ./xdisp [--connect] makes an automatic connection to the writers of the
system output
